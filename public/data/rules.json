Example: Tibbers has the tag Annie, but it is a signature\nunit, not a champion unit. It cannot be your Chosen Champion, even if your\nChampion Legend has the tag Annie.\n103.2.a.3. A player’s Chosen Champion is both the specific card chosen for this slot during\nDeck Building and also any Champion Unit with the same name as the specific\ncard selected for this specific slot during the course of play.

It is programmatically selected based on its characteristics rather than chosen by the spell or\nability’s controller.\ne.g., “Kill all units at a battlefield” targets a battlefield, but does not target any\nunits.\ne.g., “Kill all units at battlefields” doesn’t target anything.\ne.g., “Destroy a unit. Its controller draws 2 cards” targets the unit, but not its\ncontroller.\ne.g., “Ready your legend” doesn’t target anything, because you can only have one\nlegend.\ne.g., “Ready a friendly legend” targets a legend, because in a 2v2 game there are\ntwo friendly legends.\ne.g., “Recycle all cards in your trash” doesn’t target anything, because it affects all\ncards and you only have one trash.\n352.10.d.1. This exception applies solely to objects for which no choice is ever possible.\n352.10.d.2. This exception does not apply to objects that are the only valid choice at the\nmoment a spell or ability is placed on the chain, but which would require a choice\nunder other circumstances.\ne.g., “Kill a unit at a battlefield” always targets a unit, even if that unit is\nthe only unit currently at a battlefield.\n352.10.e. It is part of a set of objects chosen in whole or in part by other players.\ne.g., “Each player kills a unit they control” does not target. Each player, including\nthe one who played the spell, chooses a unit to kill as the spell or ability resolves.\n352.10.f. It is identified in an instruction that a player “must” complete.\ne.g., “You must recycle one of your runes” doesn’t target anything. You choose from\namong your runes as the spell or ability resolves.\ne.g., “Recycle a rune you control” targets a rune. You choose a rune you control as\nyou put the spell or ability on the chain.",

A target for such a spell may\ncease to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell\nwas played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement\notherwise.\n356.3.e.5. If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the\nspell as it resolves.\nExample: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says \"Deal 4 to a unit at a\nbattlefield. Draw 1.\" The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit\nto their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any\ndamage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1.\n356.3.e.6. Instructions that can't be followed, either because of illegal targets or other\ncircumstances, are ignored.\n356.3.e.7. If all of an instruction's Targets become Invalid or Unavailable by the time the\nspell is finished being played, that instruction will not execute.\n356.3.e.8. If an instruction has more than one Target and fewer than all of the Targets\nbecome Invalid or Unavailable by the time the spell is finished being played, the\ninstruction will execute, with only the Targets available and valid being operated\non.\n356.3.e.9. The process for a card's choice becoming Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as\nmistargeting.\nExample: A spell has the instruction \"Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.\"\nBefore that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base.\nThe instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it\nchooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute,\nthe unit was no longer valid as a choice.\n356.3.e.10. It is possible for none of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all\nof them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becoming Invalid or\nUnavailable. In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played.\nExample: A player plays a spell that reads \"Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield\"\nwith no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield.\nThey also control a unit with the ability \"When you play a spell, give me +1\n[M] this turn.\" Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its\nbase. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but\nthe unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M].\n356.3.e.11. Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and\nignored otherwise.\nExample: A player plays a spell that says \"Discard 2, then draw 2\" If their\nhand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They'll still draw\n2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2.\n356.3.e.12. If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or\npermanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information\nis no longer available, that check returns \"null\" and all calculations based on it are\nignored.\nExamples:\nA unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null Might, null\ncost, etc.\nA unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted\nnor readied, etc.\nBaited Hook says \"[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of\nyour Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might\nup to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle\nthe rest.\" While Baited Hook’s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts\nwith a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the\nfriendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be killed and its Might is\ntreated as null. Baited Hook’s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their\nMain Deck, but can’t choose any unit from among them.\n356.3.e.13. A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can\n\"look back\" at its characteristics before it changes zones.",

The Combat Damage Step only occurs if both Attacking and Defending units remain at\nthe location.\n443.1.a.1. If neither Attacking Units nor Defending Units remain at this stage, the Combat\nDamage Step is skipped.\n443.1.b. Sum the Might of all Attacking Units.\n443.1.c. Sum the Might of all Defending Units.\n443.1.d. Starting with the Attacker, each player assigns an amount of damage equal to their\nsummed Might among the other's Units.\n443.1.d.1. Assigning Damage is not Dealing Damage.\n443.1.d.1.a. When all Damage is assigned, it will be Dealt simultaneously. These\nactions are not synonymous.\n443.1.d.2. Abilities or effects may influence the order in which damage is assigned. Reminder:\nLethal Damage is non-zero damage equaling or exceeding the Might of a Unit.\n443.1.d.3. Units must have lethal damage assigned to them in full before damage is assigned\nto a different Unit.\nExample: If a player has 5 damage to distribute among four 3 Might units,\nthey may not choose to assign 2 damage to one of the units and 1 damage\nto each of the remaining 3. They must assign at least 3 damage to one,\nand the remaining 2 to another.\n443.1.d.4. Units cannot have more damage assigned to them than the minimum required to\nconstitute lethal damage unless no further units remain to have damage assigned\nto them.\n443.1.d.5. A player must obey all requirements and restrictions on damage assignment if\nable.\nExample: A player is assigning damage to the following units: a unit with\nTank (\"I must be assigned combat damage first.\"); Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I\nmust be assigned combat damage last.\"); and another unit without any\nabilities. That player must assign combat damage first to the unit with\nTank, then to the unit with no abilities, then to Caitlyn.\n443.1.d.6. If multiple Units have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them\ndamage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in\nany order.\nExample: A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units\nwith Tank (\"I must be assigned combat damage first.\") and one unit with\nno abilities. That player chooses one of the units with Tank and assigns\ncombat damage to it. Then they must assign any remaining damage first\nto the other unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities.\n443.1.d.7. If a Unit has one or more Abilities or effects applying to it that demand it be\nassigned damage in a specific way that is exclusionary, then the assigning player\nchooses only one of those abilities to apply when assigning damage.\nExample: Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I must be assigned combat damage last.\")\nhas been given the Tank ability (\"I must be assigned combat damage\nfirst.\"). A player is assigning damage to this Caitlyn with Tank and two units\nwith no abilities. That player can’t fulfill both of Caitlyn’s damage\nrequirements, so they may choose to assign damage to Caitlyn first,\nfulfilling the Tank requirement, or last, fulfilling Caitlyn’s printed\nrequirement. They can’t choose to apply damage to Caitlyn in between the\nother two units, because that wouldn’t fulfill either requirement.\n443.1.d.8. If there is more than one unit in which this situation applies to, each unit is dealt\nwith individually. The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and\nthen resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one\nunit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage\nin any order as normal within that priority.\nExample: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I must be assigned combat\ndamage last.\") have been given the Tank ability (\"I must be assigned\ncombat damage first.\"). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns\nand one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns’ Tank\nrequirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit.\n443.1.d.9. If a unit cannot be dealt damage, then no amount of damage can be considered\nlethal. Such a unit is exempt from any considerations of mandatory assignment.\nExample: Kayn, Unleashed says “If I have moved twice this turn, I don't\ntake damage.” While Kayn can’t take damage, it is ignored for the\npurposes of assigning lethal damage in combat.\n443.1.e. Deal Damage to each unit equal to the amount assigned to it.",

They describe the actions to be taken as the spell or ability resolves.\n134.2.c. Keywords\n134.2.c.1. Keywords are short words or phrases that represent longer abilities or instructions.\nSee rule 726. Keywords for more information.\n134.2.c.2. Keywords may or may not have reminder text.\n134.2.d. Reminder Text\n134.2.d.1. Reminder text appears in italics and parentheses.\n134.2.d.2. Its purpose is to summarize relevant rules, including keywords and other rules.\n134.2.d.3. The presence, absence, or exact wording of reminder text has no effect on game\nfunction.\n134.2.e. Symbols\n134.2.e.1. Rules text sometimes contains symbols that express game concepts. Each symbol\nalso has a shorthand used to represent it in written text.\n134.2.e.2. The cost of Exhausting a Permanent is represented by the “exhaust symbol,” which\nresembles a card turning sideways. Its shorthand is [E].

Domain for more information.\n134.2.e.5. Power of any Domain is represented by a swirling rainbow symbol. Its shorthand is\n[A].\n134.2.e.5.a.

Power of a domain corresponding to a card’s own Domain is not represented by a\nsymbol, but appears in these rules similarly to other symbols. Its shorthand is [C].\n134.2.e.6.a. When a [C] shorthand is printed on a card as reminder text, it assumes\nthat card’s usual Domain, but it still means “one Power of this card’s\nDomain.”\n134.2.e.6.b. A [C] shorthand on a card with no Domain or with multiple Domains is\nprocessed as [A] instead.",

It is in a zone whose information status is not Public.\ne.g., “Ready a legend” targets a legend, because the Legend Zone is Public.\ne.g., “Return a unit from your trash to your hand” targets a unit card in your trash,\nbecause your trash is Public.\ne.g., “You may play a unit from your hand, ignoring its costs” does not target a unit\ncard in your hand, because your hand is not a public zone.\n352.10.a.1. Public zones are Battlefield Zones, Bases, Trashes, Legend Zones, Champion Zones,\nand Facedown Zones.\n352.10.b. It is included only as part of a targeting restriction for another choice.\ne.g., “Kill a unit at a battlefield” targets a unit, but not a battlefield, because the\nunits are targets and “at a battlefield” is a restriction.\ne.g., “Kill all units at a battlefield” targets a battlefield, but not any units.\ne.g., “Move a unit to a battlefield” targets both a unit and a battlefield.\n352.10.c. It is included only as part of a cost, trigger condition, or replacement effect.\ne.g., “As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit” doesn’t target anything.\ne.g., “When a friendly unit dies, kill a gear” targets a gear, but not a friendly unit.\ne.g., “When you play me, the next time a friendly unit would die this turn, return it\nto your hand instead” doesn’t target anything. The replacement effect applies\nwhen any friendly unit dies.\ne.g., “Choose a friendly unit. The next time it would die this turn, return it to your\nhand instead” targets a friendly unit, because “choose a friendly unit” is not part of\nthe replacement effect.\n352.10.c.1. This includes costs within instructions, identified by phrases like “[do X] to [do Y].”\nThe cost within that instruction is “[do X].”\ne.g., “When I hold, you may kill another friendly unit here to draw 1” does\nnot target anything.\ne.g., “When you play me, you may spend a buff to move a friendly unit”\ntargets the friendly unit, but not the buff.\n352.10.d. It is programmatically selected based on its characteristics rather than chosen by the spell or\nability’s controller.\ne.g., “Kill all units at a battlefield” targets a battlefield, but does not target any\nunits.\ne.g., “Kill all units at battlefields” doesn’t target anything.\ne.g., “Destroy a unit. Its controller draws 2 cards” targets the unit, but not its\ncontroller.\ne.g., “Ready your legend” doesn’t target anything, because you can only have one\nlegend.\ne.g., “Ready a friendly legend” targets a legend, because in a 2v2 game there are\ntwo friendly legends.\ne.g., “Recycle all cards in your trash” doesn’t target anything, because it affects all\ncards and you only have one trash.\n352.10.d.1. This exception applies solely to objects for which no choice is ever possible.\n352.10.d.2. This exception does not apply to objects that are the only valid choice at the\nmoment a spell or ability is placed on the chain, but which would require a choice\nunder other circumstances.\ne.g., “Kill a unit at a battlefield” always targets a unit, even if that unit is\nthe only unit currently at a battlefield.\n352.10.e. It is part of a set of objects chosen in whole or in part by other players.\ne.g., “Each player kills a unit they control” does not target. Each player, including\nthe one who played the spell, chooses a unit to kill as the spell or ability resolves.\n352.10.f. It is identified in an instruction that a player “must” complete.\ne.g., “You must recycle one of your runes” doesn’t target anything. You choose from\namong your runes as the spell or ability resolves.\ne.g., “Recycle a rune you control” targets a rune. You choose a rune you control as\nyou put the spell or ability on the chain.",

As a Reaction, another player gives two of those Recruits +1\n[M], so the Recruits’ Mights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then Fox-Fire resolves.

They could choose to kill the two 2 [M] Recruits, or\nthe two 1 [M] Recruits plus one 2 [M] Recruit. The units they choose are Fox-Fire’s\nremaining legal targets.

A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer meets the targeting\nrequirements of the spell, or if it has changed Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone.\n356.3.e.3. If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain,\nthen meets them again, it's a legal target.\nExample: A spell targets \"a unit at a battlefield.\" A player reacts with a spell\nthat moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that\nmoves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is\na legal target.\n356.3.e.4. If a target changes Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone and then returns to its\noriginal zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the same\nobject.\nExamples:\nAn enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an\nenemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield.\nA unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit\nor if its Might is greater than 3.\nSomething that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer\nexhausted. (It can't stop being \"something.\")\nA spell that's played from hidden can normally only target its own\nbattlefield or something at that battlefield. A target for such a spell may\ncease to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell\nwas played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement\notherwise.\n356.3.e.5. If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the\nspell as it resolves.\nExample: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says \"Deal 4 to a unit at a\nbattlefield. Draw 1.\" The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit\nto their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any\ndamage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1.\n356.3.e.6. Instructions that can't be followed, either because of illegal targets or other\ncircumstances, are ignored.\n356.3.e.7. If all of an instruction's Targets become Invalid or Unavailable by the time the\nspell is finished being played, that instruction will not execute.\n356.3.e.8. If an instruction has more than one Target and fewer than all of the Targets\nbecome Invalid or Unavailable by the time the spell is finished being played, the\ninstruction will execute, with only the Targets available and valid being operated\non.\n356.3.e.9. The process for a card's choice becoming Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as\nmistargeting.\nExample: A spell has the instruction \"Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.\"\nBefore that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base.\nThe instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it\nchooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute,\nthe unit was no longer valid as a choice.\n356.3.e.10. It is possible for none of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all\nof them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becoming Invalid or\nUnavailable. In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played.\nExample: A player plays a spell that reads \"Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield\"\nwith no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield.\nThey also control a unit with the ability \"When you play a spell, give me +1\n[M] this turn.\" Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its\nbase. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but\nthe unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M].\n356.3.e.11. Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and\nignored otherwise.\nExample: A player plays a spell that says \"Discard 2, then draw 2\" If their\nhand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They'll still draw\n2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2.\n356.3.e.12. If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or\npermanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information\nis no longer available, that check returns \"null\" and all calculations based on it are\nignored.\nExamples:\nA unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null Might, null\ncost, etc.\nA unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted\nnor readied, etc.\nBaited Hook says \"[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of\nyour Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might\nup to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle\nthe rest.\" While Baited Hook’s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts\nwith a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the\nfriendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be killed and its Might is\ntreated as null. Baited Hook’s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their\nMain Deck, but can’t choose any unit from among them.\n356.3.e.13. A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can\n\"look back\" at its characteristics before it changes zones.",

The “do this” phrasing on Falling Star means that it has a reflexive\ntriggered ability, which places two triggered abilities on the chain. As each of those\ntriggered abilities resolve, it deals damage to the unit chosen for that ability.

If a Unit has one or more Abilities or effects applying to it that demand it be\nassigned damage in a specific way that is exclusionary, then the assigning player\nchooses only one of those abilities to apply when assigning damage.\nExample: Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I must be assigned combat damage last.\")\nhas been given the Tank ability (\"I must be assigned combat damage\nfirst.\"). A player is assigning damage to this Caitlyn with Tank and two units\nwith no abilities. That player can’t fulfill both of Caitlyn’s damage\nrequirements, so they may choose to assign damage to Caitlyn first,\nfulfilling the Tank requirement, or last, fulfilling Caitlyn’s printed\nrequirement. They can’t choose to apply damage to Caitlyn in between the\nother two units, because that wouldn’t fulfill either requirement.\n443.1.d.8. If there is more than one unit in which this situation applies to, each unit is dealt\nwith individually. The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and\nthen resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one\nunit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage\nin any order as normal within that priority.\nExample: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (\"I must be assigned combat\ndamage last.\") have been given the Tank ability (\"I must be assigned\ncombat damage first.\"). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns\nand one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns’ Tank\nrequirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit.\n443.1.d.9. If a unit cannot be dealt damage, then no amount of damage can be considered\nlethal. Such a unit is exempt from any considerations of mandatory assignment.\nExample: Kayn, Unleashed says “If I have moved twice this turn, I don't\ntake damage.” While Kayn can’t take damage, it is ignored for the\npurposes of assigning lethal damage in combat.\n443.1.e. Deal Damage to each unit equal to the amount assigned to it.",
