# Agent Workflow Rules

This project uses a 6-agent cascade workflow. Each agent has specific responsibilities and cannot proceed without completing their blockers.

## Available Agents

When invoking agents, use their designations:
- `@architect` - System architecture, ADRs, technical decisions
- `@designer` - UI/UX specifications, component design
- `@coder` - Implementation
- `@tester` - Test coverage
- `@documentor` - Documentation
- `@closer` - Final validation, PR creation

## Agent Rules Location

Full agent definitions are in `.cursor/agents/`:
- `.cursor/agents/architect.md`
- `.cursor/agents/designer.md`
- `.cursor/agents/coder.md`
- `.cursor/agents/tester.md`
- `.cursor/agents/documentor.md`
- `.cursor/agents/closer.md`

## Workflow Overview

See `.cursor/WORKFLOW.md` for the complete workflow documentation.

## Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each agent does ONE thing well
   - Agents do NOT do each other's work
   - Coder doesn't write tests, Tester doesn't write docs

2. **Blockers Enforce Quality**
   - Agents cannot skip prerequisites
   - Each agent has a checklist that must be complete
   - Blockers are documented in each agent file

3. **Clear Handoffs**
   - Each agent creates documentation in `.cursor/features/active/<feature>/`
   - Handoff prompts are generated for the next agent
   - Context is preserved through the cascade

4. **Human Reviews at End**
   - All work flows to a Pull Request
   - Human reviews the complete change
   - Merge happens through GitHub, never locally

## Standards

### Branch Naming
```
feature/<kebab-case-name>
fix/<kebab-case-name>
chore/<kebab-case-name>
```

### Commit Messages
```
type(scope): description

feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

### File Documentation
Every `.ts`/`.tsx` file needs:
- Code file: `Component.tsx`
- Test file: `Component.spec.tsx`
- Doc file: `Component.md`

## Starting a Feature

1. Run `npm run feature:start`
2. Invoke `@architect` with your feature request
3. Follow the cascade through each agent
4. Review PR created by `@closer`

## Project Context: Rule Bound

Rule Bound is an accessible RPG rules reference web app. Key considerations:
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance required
- React + TypeScript stack
- Focus on teaching and reference use cases
